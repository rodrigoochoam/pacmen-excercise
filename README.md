# PacMen Exercise

## Purpose

Welcome to the PacMen Exercise! This fun and exploratory exercise is designed to put your skills to the test. Remember how you were able to manipulate the movements of PacMan across the browser window in previous exercises? In this challenge, you'll create multiple PacMen that move about the browser window independently, demonstrating your understanding of array methods and DOM manipulation.

## How to Play

Visit the PacMen Exercise: [Play PacMen](https://pacmen-rom.netlify.app/)

- Click the "Add PacMan" button to create a new PacMan at a random position on the screen.
- Click the "Start Game" button, and the PacMen you've created will start moving at random velocities within the web page.
- Watch as the PacMen move around the screen. When a PacMan hits the edge of the screen, it will change position to stay within the frame of the web page.

## How to Run Locally

To run the PacMen Exercise on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository. Use the following command to clone the project to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rodrigoochoam/pacmen-exercise.git

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change your working directory to the newly cloned project:

    ```bash
    cd pacmen-exercise

3. **Start a Local Server**: To serve the project locally, you can use the npx http-server command. If you don't have http-server installed globally, it can be installed using npm:

    ```bash
    npm install --global http-server

Then start this server with:
    ```bash
    npx http-server

4. **Open in a Web Browser**: Once the server is running, you'll see a message indicating the server address (usually http://localhost:8080). Open your web browser and go to that address to access the PacMen Exercise.
Now you can enjoy the exercise locally on your machine, explore the code, and make any desired modifications.

Note: Ensure you have Git and Node.js (which includes npm) installed on your system before following these steps. 

## Roadmap of Future Improvements

While this exercise is already a fun and educational challenge, you can consider future improvements such as:

- Implementing additional game features or power-ups.
- Enhancing the user interface and graphics.
- Adding scorekeeping or a game timer.
